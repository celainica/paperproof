-- TODO: this is an «examples» repo - the real «paperproof» library is in /lean subfolder.
-- We're only naming it "paperproof" here to accommodate to lean reservoir, see https://github.com/Paper-Proof/paperproof/pull/42.
-- Note that we're naming it lowercase paperproof to avoid circular dependency error.
-- In general, this should still be called «example», let's see how to deal with it when https://reservoir.lean-lang.org is more mature.

-- If you're developing locally, this imports paperproof from a local "./lean" folder
